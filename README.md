## CONCEPT

Development of the front-end of a website using interactive data from an API, based on the React.js framework.<br><br>
If you've stumbled into League of Legends and think you know everything about the game, you've come to the right place.
Use all those hours spent learning the characters, their skills, how to play... Challenge yourself and get on the leaderboard and show everyone that, if you can't win games, you at least know the lore ðŸ¤“

And a little bonus for absolute fans : Smash or Pass ! This game, often played in groups, is about judging whether a figure (in this case, the game's champions) attracts you or not.<br>
- Smash = Attractive<br>
- Pass = Not interested, pass<br><br>
Do not hesitate to check out the statistics page with the most smashed and the most passed, it sometimes reveals unexpected results... Have fun !<br><br>
